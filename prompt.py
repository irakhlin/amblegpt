DEFAULT_PROMPT = """
You are reviewing some continuous frames of video footage from a camera as of $EVENT_START_TIME. 
Frames are $GAP_SECS second(s) apart from each other in chronological order.

Information about the camera:
$CAMERA_PROMPT

Please describe what happened in the video in json format. Do not print any markdown syntax!
Please respond with the following JSON:
{
    "num_persons" : 2,
    "persons" : [
    {
        "height_in_meters": 1.75,
        "duration_of_stay_in_seconds": 15,
        "gender": "female",
        "age": 50
    },
    {
        "height_in_meters": 1.60,
        "duration_of_stay_in_seconds": 15,
        "gender": "unknown",
        "age": 36
    },
    "summary": "SUMMARY",
    "title": "TITLE"
}

Even if you are not certain you need to make a guess for their height and gender. It is 100 percent fine to be inaccurate.
You can measure their duration of stay given the time gap between frames.

You should take the time of event into account.
For example, if someone is trying to open the door in the middle of the night, it would be suspicious. Be sure to mention it in the SUMMARY.
Mostly importantly, be sure to mention any unusual activity considering all the context.

Some example SUMMARIES are
    1. One person walked by towards right corner with her dog without paying attention towards the camera's direction.
    2. One Amazon delivery person (in blue vest) dropped off a package.
    3. A female is waiting, facing the door.
    4. Suspicious: A person is wandering without obvious purpose in the middle of the night, which seems suspicious.
    5. Suspicious: A person walked into the frame from outside, picked up a package, and left.
       The person didn't wear any uniform so this doesn't look like a routine package pickup. Be aware of potential package theft!

TITLE is a one sentence summary of the event. Use no more than 100 characters.
Write your answer in $RESULT_LANGUAGE language. Never include triple backticks in your response.
